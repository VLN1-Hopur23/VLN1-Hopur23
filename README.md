       </ul>
       <li>User is to decide what to do with those lists with seven given options</li>
       <li></li>
</ul>
    
###Digit application with the following functionality:

   <ul>
      <li>User can connect the registered person to any known computer/s</li>
      <li>User can connect the registered computer to any known scientist/s</li>
      </ul>
   <li>Users can display the list of known computer scientists in an order sorted by
    <ul>
      <li>name</li>
      <li>age</li>
      <li>birth year</li> 
      <li>death year</li>

    <li>Users can delete a scientist or a computer of the list by entering the ID number</li>
    <li>Users have the option to return to main menu in every category</li>
    <li>Users are able to connect a computer scientist to more than a single computer</li>
    <li>Users are able to connect a computer to more than a single computer scientist</li>
</ul>  

###Added features:
